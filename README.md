# Kristin's Hide and Seek
## by Kristin Dragos

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [Unreal Engine 4 VR Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com)

For this project, I used UE4.15.3. Designed for and tested with the Oculus Rift and Touch controllers.

## 3rd Party Assets Used
From the Unreal marketplace:
- Hands for VR: Basic  - These I used for the player hand models.
- Procedural Cabinets - I used just the sink from this asset pack. 
- Interactable Physical Door - I used a couple of the models from this pack. The doors, door handles, chests, and cabinet doors were all models I used from this asset pack. 

I had planned on using the cabinets (from Procedural Cabinets) and doors (from the Interactable Physical Door), but it ended up being easier to code my own cabinet interactions and animations. 

Other models were made in Blender and/or Microsoft's Paint 3D, or came in the Unreal starter content. Some of the models I created with basic shapes in Unreal.  

I used several sounds from the Oculus Audio pack/sdk.
One sound I got from freesound.org (https://freesound.org/people/plasterbrain/sounds/243020/).
